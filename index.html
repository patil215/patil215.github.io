	<h1 class="title">Neil Patil</h1>

	<p>I'm Neil. These days I work at <a href="https://www.chaidiscovery.com">Chai Discovery</a>, building models and products to make drug discovery feel less like guesswork and more like engineering.</p>

	<p>Before that I was deep in cybersecurity. I joined <a href="https://vanta.com" target="_blank">Vanta</a> early, helping turn SOC 2 compliance from a spreadsheet into software, and later shipping the first AI-powered <a href="https://www.vanta.com/products/vendor-risk-management" target="_blank">security review products</a>. I left to start a company in the space before realizing cybersecurity SaaS wasn't where I wanted to spend my life - and so wandered into biotech.</p>

	<p>I also love robots, logistics, and geopolitics. I used to work on <a href="http://ike.com" target="_blank">self-driving trucks</a>, and during the pandemic co-founded a nonprofit to deliver <a href="https://www.helpinghands.community/" target="_blank">two million meals</a>. I got a private pilot's license in 2022, and these days enjoy flying around the Bay Area, running long distances, and cooking meals that are way more effort than they should be.</p>
