	<h1 class="title">Neil Patil</h1>

	<p>I'm Neil! I'm building <a href="https://syntra.io">Syntra.</a></p>

	<p>I'm interested in helping businesses build and prove good security. I was an early engineer & product manager at <a href="https://vanta.com" target="_blank">Vanta</a> and launched our first enterprise products to <a href="https://www.vanta.com/products/vendor-risk-management" target="_blank">streamline security reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.vanta.com/resources/introducing-vantas-connectors-api" target="_blank">ingest security data</a>.</a> Back in college, I ran UT Austin's competitive cybersecurity team and <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/69010/" target="_blank">a few CTFs</a>... which is what convinced me there's a mountain of work in cybersecurity.</p>

	<p>I also love vehicles and transportation logistics. I used to work on <a href="http://ike.com" target="_blank">self-driving trucks</a>, and during the pandemic, I cofounded a non-profit to deliver <a href="https://www.helpinghands.community/" target="_blank">two million meals</a>. I also got a Private Pilot's license in 2022 and enjoy flying locally around the Bay Area.</p>

	<p>And before that... I stumbled onto the internet by building <a href="http://geobellsapp.com/" target="_blank">lots</a> <a href="https://shouldigetstudentloans.com/">of</a> <a href="https://github.com/project-manatee" target="_blank">apps</a> during boring Austin summers.</p>
	
	<p>I like running long distances, flying aircraft, and cooking overly extravagant, time-consuming-and-totally-not-a-form-of-procrastination meals.</p>

	<p>Here's my <a href="https://twitter.com/realdealpatil" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/patil215" target="_blank">Github</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/realdealpatil/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="mailto:neilpatil215@gmail.com">email</a>, and <a href="https://beliapp.co/lists/realdealpatil">favorite restaurants.</a></p>
