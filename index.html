	<p>Hey there! I'm Neil.<p>

	<p>I currently work at <a href="https://vanta.com" target="_blank">Vanta</a> in San Francisco, building tools to prove security and improve consumer trust.</p>

	<p>Prior to joining Vanta, I co-founded <a href="https://helpinghands.community/">Helping Hands Community</a>, a non-profit providing food delivery during COVID-19. Before that, I worked on self-driving trucks at <a href="https://ikerobotics.com" target="_blank">Ike</a>, and spent time at <a href="https://facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>, <a href="https://indeed.com" target="_blank">Indeed</a>, and <a href="https://atlassian.com" target="_blank">Atlassian</a>.</p>

	<p>My interests are pretty fluid - but as of January 2021, I'm interested in product strategy, organizational security, robotics, perfecting my cooking skills, running, and security education (in school, I was president of <a href="https://www.isss.io/" target="_blank">ISSS</a>).</p>

	<!-- <p>I'm also passionate about security education. In school, I was president of . We run Capture-the-Flag contests and teach basic fundamentals, with the goal of making UT's security community more accessible, competitive, and diverse.</p> -->
