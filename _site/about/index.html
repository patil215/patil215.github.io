<h2 id="golden-gate-invitational-is-led-by-national-science-olympiad-medalists-from-stanford-and-uc-berkeley">Golden Gate Invitational is led by National Science Olympiad medalists from Stanford and UC Berkeley.</h2>

<p>Our mission is to improve the Science Olympiad experience of high school students nationwide. The members of Golden Gate Science Olympiad have volunteered at Science Olympiad tournaments across the country, proctoring events and assisting behind the scenes at invitational, regional, and state tournaments. On January 27, 2018, Golden Gate Science Olympiad will be hosting their second tournament at UC Berkeley. This winter, you can look forward to:</p>

<p><em>Quality Events.</em> Each of the 23 Division C national events will be written, run, and reviewed by a past national medalist or national event supervisor. This also means coaches will NOT have to volunteer or write tests for the invitational! Teams will receive copies of the tests and answer keys following the competition.</p>

<p><em>Exciting Location.</em> Our location in the middle of Silicon Valley allows us to invite speakers and hold workshops from ventures across the Bay Area. We hope to capture the unique, vibrant atmosphere of this STEM innovation hub, all within a beautiful day in the sunny state of California.</p>

<p><em>Experienced Hosts.</em> Our board consists of National Medalists that have volunteered and competed at invitationals across the country. As both competitors and organizers, we have been exposed to both sides of a tournament. Armed with this knowledge and experience, we are determined to bring your team an unforgettable experience.</p>

<p><em>Dual School Benefits.</em> This tournament boasts the unique experiences of both Stanford and Berkeley undergraduate students. Our network is double the size of even the most competitive schools, allowing us to acquire quality test writers and proctors with National Competition experience. Competitors will also have the opportunity to network with current Stanford and Berkeley student leaders.</p>

<p><em>Stress-Free Scheduling.</em>  Our schedule is closely modeled after the national schedule so that team members will receive the same events at our tournament as they will at nationals. We will work closely with teams to ensure a smooth process from sign-up to competition.</p>
