<div class="col-md-12">
    <h1 class="title">Reading</h1>
    
    <p>My favorite part of other people's websites are links to what they read. So, here are mine.</p>


    <h2>Books</h2>

    <p>Friend me on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53946421-neil">Goodreads</a>! My book ratings and "want to read" sections are pretty indicative.</p>


    <h2>People & Blogs</h2>

    <p>Places on the internet I regularly learn from. Mostly software & technology-related, but I'm branching out over time.</p>

    <p>I update this periodically. If you have recommendations, <a href="mailto:neilpatil215@gmail.com">let me know</a>!</p>


    {% assign links = site.data.links | sort: "name" %}
    <p><ul>
        {% for link in links %}
        <li>
            <a target="_blank" href="{{ link.link }}">
                {{ link.name }}
            </a>
        </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul></p>
